## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### The Three Critical Concepts

1. **Nonces = Unique IDs for Cross-Chain Transfers**
   - Prevent replay attacks
   - Blockchain ensures atomicity
   - Check before executing

2. **Events = Async Communication Mechanism**
   - Bridge emits → Stored in logs
   - Relayer polls RPC → Discovers
   - NO push mechanism

3. **Supply Conservation = Security Invariant**
   - `locked === wrapped` always
   - Test in every integration
   - If broken = exploit

## 💡 Quick Start Reading Path

**30-minute deep understanding:**
```
1. QUICK-REFERENCE.md (5 min)
   └─► Get architecture overview

2. CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-DEEP-DIVE.md
   ├─► Nonce System (5 min)
   ├─► Event Lifecycle (10 min)
   └─► Blockchain Architecture (10 min)
```

**Interview preparation (1 hour):**
```
1. Read both docs completely
2. Review your actual code in:
   - contracts/bridges/
   - relayer/src/
   - test/integration/
3. Practice explaining concepts out loud
4. Prepare examples from your code
```

**Production readiness (ongoing):**
```
1. Study "Production Considerations" section
2. Research mentioned bridges:
   - LayerZero
   - Wormhole
   - Connext
3. Implement suggested improvements
4. Deploy to testnet
5. Write monitoring & alerts
```
